# cor(p)s-etrangers

*Cor(p)s Ã©trangers* is a collaborative sonic/musical research project started by Emmanuel Madan and Michael Mansourati. The assorted files in this repository are sonic "toys" built in SuperCollider intended to be used as tools for discovering, mapping, and eking out the acoustic idiosyncracies of various low-end brass instruments, i.e tubas.
